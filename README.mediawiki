'''FUSE Filesystem 4 Dropbox''' is a FUSE plugin whichs allows a local mount of your
global Dropbox or jailed application folder.

To improve the browsing experience of your Dropbox content this plugin will cache
the structure for a certain amount of time. This python script uses '''libfuse''' to
provide FUSE function to the operating system.

=== Requirements ===
There are some requirements which have to be fulfilled to make this plugin work.
* FUSE has to be installed (http://fuse.sourceforge.net/). On Debian/Ubuntu you can install FUSE with
 apt-get install libfuse2
* Python pkg-resources must be installed. On Debian/Ubuntu you can install it via
 apt-get install python-pkg-resources
* You need pip to install Python packages. On Debian/Ubuntu just use
 apt-get install python-pip
* You need to install the "dropbox" Python package which is required by FF4D. This can be done via the recently installed pip:
 pip install dropbox
* The user must have the permission to mount FUSE filesystems. On Debian/Ubuntu systems the user must belong to the group "fuse".
 adduser <user> fuse

=== Compatible systems ===
I've tested this script running on:

* Linux X86
* Linux X64
* Mac OS X

Other systems may work...

=== Authorize access ===
Running '''FF4D''' for the first time without providing an access token, the script will guide you through a
authorization process where you can choose which permission you'll grant to this application.

You can use the enclosed '''./getDropboxAccessToken.py''' script to fetch
the token. But remember for this case that you have to add an Dropbox application within
the [https://www.dropbox.com/developers Dropbox Developer home] by yourself, too.

'''Please secure your access token. NOBODY may know it! This token allows full access
to your configured dropbox space.'''

=== Usage ===
Quick start:

 ./ff4d.py <mount folder>

The accesstoken can optionally supplied via commandline. Normaly the plugin will ask you just one time
and saves it to a configuration file.

You can see all the mighty arguments by showing the help:

 ./ff4d.py -h

Greets and have fun with this little goodie...
